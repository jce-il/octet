#2.2 ANGLES
#Angles maybe formed between groups of atoms in a molecule, between sub-systems such as the
#body, a wing or an engine of an airplane, the axes of manipulators of movable robots. Angles are
#measure by real numbers having units of radians or degrees. Angles may be planar (2-D) or
#spatial (3-D). Angles are varied by increments between say zero to 2*Ï€ radians.
